# iceOS-Beta01: Strategy & Roadmap

## Vision
A robust, flexible, and scalable AI workflow system that enables users to orchestrate, extend, and visually build complex agentic workflows using nodes, tools, and chains.

---

## Phased Roadmap

### **Part 1: Housekeeping**
- **Code Review:**
  - Identify technical debt, anti-patterns, and areas for improvement.
  - Review AiNode, ScriptChain, ToolService for separation of concerns, error handling, test coverage, and documentation.
- **Refactor:**
  - Modularize code, standardize interfaces, improve docstrings, and remove dead code.
  - See ENGINEERING_TODO.md for detailed technical tasks.

### **Part 2: Tooling**
- **Basic Tools:**
  - Ensure foundational tools are robust and well-tested.
- **Advanced Tools:**
  - Add and test advanced tools (e.g., web search, API calls, chaining).
  - See ENGINEERING_TODO.md for tool development and testing best practices.

### **Part 3: System Success**
- **Complex Chains:**
  - Demonstrate multi-step, multi-tool workflows.
  - Build integration tests for real-world scenarios.
- **Metrics & Observability:**
  - Track performance, errors, and usage.

### **Part 4: Copilot (AI-Driven Workflow Builder)**
- **Conceptual Requirements:**
  - Users can describe workflows in natural language; the system proposes draft ScriptChains (nodes, tools, agents).
  - Users can edit, re-prompt, or refine generated workflows in a visual canvas.
- **Implementation Requirements:**
  - **Node Builder:** UI/logic for creating/configuring nodes.
  - **Tool Builder:** UI/logic for defining new tools.
  - **Agent Builder:** Compose agents from nodes/tools, define agent behaviors.
  - **Chain Builder:** Visual/programmatic interface for assembling nodes, tools, and agents into a ScriptChain.
  - **Copilot Engine:** LLM-powered backend for parsing prompts, suggesting drafts, and refining workflows.
