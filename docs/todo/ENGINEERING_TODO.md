# iceOS-Beta01: Engineering TODO

_See also: [STRATEGY.md](STRATEGY.md) for high-level roadmap and conceptual requirements._

---

## 1. Configuration Management
- [ ] Move hardcoded values to environment variables
- [ ] Use a `.env` file for local development
- [ ] Centralize configuration in a single Pydantic `Settings` class
- [ ] Use configuration files (YAML/JSON) for non-secret settings
- [ ] Validate configuration at startup
- [ ] Log configuration (excluding secrets) on startup
- [ ] Use feature flags for experimental features
- [ ] Separate configuration for different environments
- [ ] Use sensible defaults
- [ ] Document configuration in `CONFIG.md` or `README.md`

## 2. Modularity and Decoupling
- [ ] Service-based architecture (LLMService, ToolService, NodeService)
- [ ] Dependency injection for all services and configurations

## 3. Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Unit tests for all modules
- [ ] End-to-end tests for workflows and chains
- [ ] Property-based testing (e.g., Hypothesis)

## 4. Logging, Observability, and Evaluation
- [ ] Structured logging (e.g., JSON)
- [ ] Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- [ ] Metrics and dashboards (Grafana, etc.)
- [ ] Built-in evaluation for scriptchains and nodes (quality, performance)

## 5. Error Handling and Resilience
- [ ] Circuit breakers for external services
- [ ] Retry logic for transient errors
- [ ] Fallbacks for service failures

## 6. Security and Permissions
- [ ] Authentication and authorization (OAuth, JWT, etc.)
- [ ] Input validation for all APIs and user inputs
- [ ] Audit logs for user actions

## 7. Documentation and Examples
- [ ] API documentation (Swagger/ReDoc)
- [ ] Architecture diagrams (PlantUML/Mermaid)
- [ ] Runbooks for common operations

## 8. Extensibility and Plugins
- [ ] Plugin system for third-party extensions (nodes, tools, agents, chains)
- [ ] Integration adapters for LangChain, CrewAI, LlamaIndex, etc.
- [ ] API for external tool and agent registration
- [ ] Hooks and middleware for request interception

## 9. Performance and Scalability
- [ ] Caching for expensive operations
- [ ] Asynchronous processing for I/O-bound tasks
- [ ] Horizontal scaling (multi-instance, load balancer)

## 10. Versioning and Compatibility
- [ ] API versioning (`/api/v1/...`)
- [ ] Backward compatibility and migration paths

---

## 11. Scriptchain Interoperability & Protocols
- [ ] Design a minimal protocol for ScriptChain-to-ScriptChain communication (inspiration: A2A)
- [ ] Define message/task formats for cross-chain requests and responses
- [ ] Implement service discovery for ScriptChains (local and distributed)
- [ ] Add authentication and authorization for inter-chain calls
- [ ] Document protocol and provide usage examples

---

## Tooling (See STRATEGY.md Part 2)
- [ ] Audit and test all basic tools
- [ ] Add advanced tools (web search, API, chaining)
- [ ] Validate tool schemas and error handling

## System Success (See STRATEGY.md Part 3)
- [ ] Build complex chains with multiple tools and nodes
- [ ] Integration tests for real-world scenarios
- [ ] Metrics and observability for chain execution

## Copilot & Builders (See STRATEGY.md Part 4)
- [ ] Node builder (UI/logic, schema-driven)
- [ ] Tool builder (UI/logic, schema-driven)
- [ ] Agent builder (composition logic, memory/goals)
- [ ] Chain builder (visual/programmatic, canvas view)
- [ ] Copilot engine (LLM-powered workflow suggestion, prompt-to-architecture)
- [ ] Iterative refinement (re-prompt, edit, versioning)
- [ ] Human-in-the-loop collaboration (multi-user editing, feedback)

## Frosty Copilot
- [ ] Natural language prompt interface for workflow creation
- [ ] Draft architecture generation and explanation
- [ ] Canvas view for visual editing and feedback
- [ ] Integration with Node/Tool/Agent/Chain builders
- [ ] User feedback loop and learning from edits
