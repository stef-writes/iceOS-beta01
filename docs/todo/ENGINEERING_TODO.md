# iceOS-Beta01: Engineering TODO

_See also: [STRATEGY.md](STRATEGY.md) for high-level roadmap and conceptual requirements._

---

## 1. Configuration Management
- [ ] Move hardcoded values to environment variables
- [ ] Use a `.env` file for local development
- [ ] Centralize configuration in a single Pydantic `Settings` class
- [ ] Use configuration files (YAML/JSON) for non-secret settings
- [ ] Validate configuration at startup
- [ ] Log configuration (excluding secrets) on startup
- [ ] Use feature flags for experimental features
- [ ] Separate configuration for different environments
- [ ] Use sensible defaults
- [ ] Document configuration in `CONFIG.md` or `README.md`

## 2. Modularity and Decoupling
- [ ] Service-based architecture (LLMService, ToolService, NodeService)
- [ ] Dependency injection for all services and configurations

## 3. Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Unit tests for all modules
- [ ] End-to-end tests for workflows and chains
- [ ] Property-based testing (e.g., Hypothesis)

## 4. Logging and Observability
- [ ] Structured logging (e.g., JSON)
- [ ] Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- [ ] Metrics and dashboards (Grafana, etc.)

## 5. Error Handling and Resilience
- [ ] Circuit breakers for external services
- [ ] Retry logic for transient errors
- [ ] Fallbacks for service failures

## 6. Security and Permissions
- [ ] Authentication and authorization (OAuth, JWT, etc.)
- [ ] Input validation for all APIs and user inputs
- [ ] Audit logs for user actions

## 7. Documentation and Examples
- [ ] API documentation (Swagger/ReDoc)
- [ ] Architecture diagrams (PlantUML/Mermaid)
- [ ] Runbooks for common operations

## 8. Extensibility and Plugins
- [ ] Plugin system for third-party extensions
- [ ] Hooks and middleware for request interception

## 9. Performance and Scalability
- [ ] Caching for expensive operations
- [ ] Asynchronous processing for I/O-bound tasks
- [ ] Horizontal scaling (multi-instance, load balancer)

## 10. Versioning and Compatibility
- [ ] API versioning (`/api/v1/...`)
- [ ] Backward compatibility and migration paths

---

## Tooling (See STRATEGY.md Part 2)
- [ ] Audit and test all basic tools
- [ ] Add advanced tools (web search, API, chaining)
- [ ] Validate tool schemas and error handling

## System Success (See STRATEGY.md Part 3)
- [ ] Build complex chains with multiple tools and nodes
- [ ] Integration tests for real-world scenarios
- [ ] Metrics and observability for chain execution

## Copilot & Builders (See STRATEGY.md Part 4)
- [ ] Node builder (UI/logic)
- [ ] Tool builder (UI/logic)
- [ ] Agent builder (composition logic)
- [ ] Chain builder (visual/programmatic)
- [ ] Copilot engine (LLM-powered workflow suggestion)
