# Agentic Workflow Improvements: Immediate Action Checklist

---

## High-Impact Actions for Adaptability, Reusability, and Scalability

- [ ] **Standardize and Document Node Config Schemas**
  - Ensure every node type uses a well-documented, schema-driven config (fields: `input_schema`, `output_schema`, `output_format`, `dependencies`, etc.).
  - *Benefit:* Enables validation, UI generation, and easy extension.

- [ ] **Centralize and Modularize Prompt Engineering**
  - Move all system prompt and output format logic into a single utility/module (e.g., `prompt_builder.py`).
  - *Benefit:* Ensures consistency and makes adapting to new LLMs/output types trivial.

- [ ] **Add Robust Fallbacks and Logging for Output Parsing**
  - In `AiNode`, always log when fallback logic is used (e.g., wrapping plain text as JSON). Optionally, surface these events in metrics or dashboards.
  - *Benefit:* Improves reliability, debuggability, and helps monitor LLM drift.

- [ ] **Create a Plugin/Registry System for Nodes and Tools**
  - Implement a registry or plugin loader so new node types, tools, or LLM providers can be registered dynamically.
  - *Benefit:* Future-proofs the system for third-party extensions and rapid prototyping.

- [ ] **Write End-to-End Integration Tests for Key Workflows**
  - For every major workflow (e.g., API → Tool → LLM), write a test in `tests/integration/` that exercises the full pipeline, including error and edge cases.
  - *Benefit:* Ensures robustness, makes refactoring safe, and provides living documentation.
