# Frosty: The Copilot for Agentic Workflow Creation

---

## üåü Vision

Frosty is an AI-powered copilot designed to help users create, refine, and deploy intelligent workflows‚Äîcalled **scriptchains**‚Äîby composing nodes, tools, agents, and chains. Users interact with Frosty via natural language prompts, and Frosty responds by constructing draft architectures that can be visualized, edited, and iteratively improved in a canvas view. Frosty bridges the gap between human creativity and agentic automation, making advanced AI workflows accessible and transparent.

## üß† Conceptual Requirements

### 1. **Unified Agentic Abstraction**
- Treat **nodes**, **tools**, **agents**, and **chains** as modular, composable building blocks.
- Enable seamless composition and reuse of these components.

### 2. **Copilot-Driven Creation**
- Users prompt Frosty in natural language.
- Frosty interprets intent and generates draft architectures (nodes, tools, agents, chains).
- Frosty explains its reasoning and design choices.

### 3. **Scriptchain as a Product**
- The primary deliverable is a **scriptchain**: a workflow of interconnected components.
- Scriptchains can be exported, run, deployed, and shared.

### 4. **Human-in-the-Loop Collaboration**
- Users can review, edit, and re-prompt at any stage.
- Frosty supports iterative refinement and collaborative design.

### 5. **Visual and Code-Based Interaction**
- Canvas view for drag-and-drop composition and visualization.
- Code view for direct editing and advanced customization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Requirements

### 1. **Node Builder**
- UI and API for defining new nodes (inputs, outputs, logic).
- Support for code, configuration, and visual editing.
- Node metadata (name, description, type, etc.).

### 2. **Tool Builder**
- Interface for registering and managing tools (APIs, scripts, plugins).
- Tool metadata, authentication, and test harness.
- Support for third-party and custom tool integrations.

### 3. **Agent Builder**
- Compose nodes and tools into agents with goals, memory, and policies.
- Define agent instructions, context, and accessible tools.
- Support for hierarchical and collaborative agent structures.

### 4. **Chain Builder**
- Visual and code-based editor for chaining agents/nodes/tools.
- Support for sequential, parallel, conditional, and looped flows.
- Canvas view for drag-and-drop composition and real-time visualization.

### 5. **Prompt-to-Architecture Engine**
- Frosty interprets user prompts and generates draft architectures.
- Presents drafts in the canvas for user review and refinement.
- Supports explanation and justification of design choices.

### 6. **Iterative Refinement & Collaboration**
- Users can re-prompt Frosty to modify, extend, or optimize architectures.
- Support for versioning, undo/redo, and collaborative editing.

### 7. **Execution & Evaluation**
- Run scriptchains locally or in the cloud.
- Monitor execution, debug, and evaluate performance.
- Built-in logging, error handling, and performance metrics.

### 8. **Extensibility & Integration**
- Support for integrating with external frameworks (e.g., LangChain, CrewAI, LlamaIndex).
- Plugin system for adding new node/tool/agent types.
- API for third-party extensions.

## üß© Example User Flow

1. **Prompt:**  
   "Frosty, create a workflow that scrapes news headlines, summarizes them, and emails me the summary every morning."

2. **Frosty Drafts:**  
   - Node: News Scraper  
   - Tool: Summarizer (LLM)  
   - Node: Email Sender  
   - Chain: [Scraper] ‚Üí [Summarizer] ‚Üí [Email Sender]

3. **User Reviews in Canvas:**  
   - Edits the summarizer prompt  
   - Adds a filter node for specific topics  
   - Re-prompts Frosty to optimize the chain

4. **User Runs & Monitors:**  
   - Executes the chain, reviews logs, and refines as needed
