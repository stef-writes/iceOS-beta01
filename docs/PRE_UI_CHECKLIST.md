# ScriptChain Pre-UI/CLI Readiness Checklist

## Core Functionality
- [x] Multi-level, multi-provider, context-aware execution
- [x] Parallel and sequential execution logic
- [x] Node and chain execution works end-to-end

## Schema & Model Parity
- [x] JSON Schemas and Pydantic models are in sync
- [x] All fields and metadata included
- [x] Example configs (many-to-one, one-to-many) are valid

## Validation & Error Handling
- [x] Input validation enforced (Pydantic, schema)
- [x] Graceful error handling for node/chain failures
- [ ] Edge case handling tested (e.g., circular dependencies, invalid configs)

## Testing
- [x] Integration tests for full workflow execution
- [ ] Unit tests for all major modules
- [ ] Test coverage measured and gaps addressed
- [ ] Edge case tests (missing outputs, dependency errors, etc.)

## Documentation
- [x] Architecture and schema documentation
- [x] Example configs and schema README
- [ ] API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger) available and accurate
- [ ] Developer onboarding guide (setup, add node/provider, run tests)

## DevOps & Quality
- [ ] Linting and formatting enforced (e.g., black, isort, flake8)
- [ ] Type checking (e.g., mypy) passes
- [ ] CI pipeline runs tests, linting, and type checks
- [ ] Secrets management is secure (no hardcoded API keys)

## Configuration & Extensibility
- [x] Config files for environment-specific settings
- [x] Easy to add new LLM providers or node types
- [x] Token management and limits are configurable

## Deployment & Local Dev
- [ ] Local dev environment easy to set up (requirements.txt, Docker, etc.)
- [ ] Deployment instructions are clear
- [ ] Health check endpoint for API
