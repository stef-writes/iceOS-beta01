Fantastic question! Let’s step back and think conceptually, without jargon:

---

## **What is a Node?**

### **At its core:**
A **Node** is a unit of computation or logic in a workflow or graph.  
It is a “box” that:
- **Receives input(s)**
- **Performs some operation** (computation, transformation, decision, action, etc.)
- **Produces output(s)**

---

### **What could a Node be?**

A Node can be **anything** that fits the above pattern. For example, a Node could:

- **Run an LLM prompt** (classic text generation)
- **Call a tool or function** (e.g., calculator, web search, database query)
- **Route or transform data** (e.g., select, filter, map, merge)
- **Trigger side effects** (e.g., send an email, write to a file, call an API)
- **Aggregate or combine results** (e.g., summarize, vote, reduce)
- **Make decisions** (e.g., if/else, switch/case, choose next node)
- **Orchestrate sub-flows** (e.g., run a subgraph, loop, parallelize)
- **Maintain or update state/context** (e.g., memory, history, counters)
- **Interact with users** (e.g., ask a question, get feedback)
- **Anything else you can encode as a function or process**

---

### **In Your System:**
A Node is a **configurable, composable building block** that can:
- Accept inputs (from users, other nodes, or external sources)
- Execute logic (LLM, tool, or custom code)
- Output results (to other nodes, the user, or external systems)
- Be chained, branched, or combined with other nodes to form complex workflows

---

### **Analogy:**
Think of a Node as a “cell” in a living system, or a “function” in a program, or a “step” in a recipe.  
It’s a **modular, reusable, and composable unit** of work.

---

## **Naming Implication**
If you want to keep things general and future-proof, you might simply call it:
- `Node`
- `WorkflowNode`
- `GraphNode`
- `LogicNode`
- `Block`
- `Step`

And then specialize as needed (e.g., `LLMNode`, `ToolNode`, `RouterNode`, etc.).

---

**Summary:**  
A Node is a general-purpose, pluggable unit of logic or computation in your workflow system.  
It can be as simple or as powerful as you want, limited only by what you can encode/configure.

Would you like to move forward with a more general node class and naming, or discuss how to structure this in your codebase?
